# Read the Full Tutorial

I've written a full step-by-step tutorial walking through the code, as well as explaining some concepts such as "how to organize multiple collections", as well as "how to mint privately".

You can find the article here: https://medium.com/rarible-dao/how-to-mint-a-10-000-item-generative-art-nft-collection-with-21-lines-of-javascript-dfa603cc56d5

# Customize

You can also check out the [customizable.js](customizable.js) file to learn how you can tweak the derivation key path, which lets you generate every collection from a new address, derived from a single seed.

# Troubleshoot

- If you see some error, try updating your node.js to the latest version
- Also try using `npm ci` instead of `npm install` to install the dependencies
- If none of these work, try resetting the wallet by deleting the wallet file at `~/.mushie` by running `rm ~/.mushie` (WARNING: Please make sure to back up the wallet before you delete them). Once you reset, try running the app again, and it will let you generate a new seed (or import)
